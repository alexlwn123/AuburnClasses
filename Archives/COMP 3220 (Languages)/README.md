This course was designed to teach about the implementation of compilers. The projects were assigned in the order:
1. _RubyLexer_
2. _RubyParser_
3. _RubyAST_
4. _RacketInterpreter_
Each project used the code from the previous project. By the end of the course, we had created a new, fully-functioning programming language.
