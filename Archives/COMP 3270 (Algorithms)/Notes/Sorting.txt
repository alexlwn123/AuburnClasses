Sorting a hand of cards (Insertion Sort)
  - Start with an empty hand, cards facing down on the table
  - Remove one card at a time from the table and insert it into the correct position
  - To find out the correct position, we compare it with each of the cards already in the hand from left to right

Insertion Sort (A: array [1...n]; n >= 1)
1   for j=2 to n
2     key = A[j]
3     i = j-1
4     while i > 0 and A[i] > key
5       A[i+1] = A[i]
6       i = i-1
7     A[i+1] = key
