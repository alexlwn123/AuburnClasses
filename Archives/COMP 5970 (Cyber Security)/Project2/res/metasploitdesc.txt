When learning how to detect the metasploit Eternal Blue attack, we first ran an attack on our
our network while monitoring and recording the traffic using Wireshark. On closer research
of what the Eternal Blue exploit enacts, we monitored the traffic for repeated NT requests/
responses over the network. The large amount of requests sets up the SMB for a specific
packet that will exploit system. The large NT Trans requests lead into Secondary Trans2
Requests that act as a launcher for the malware on the remote machine. This packet may 
show as a malformed packet. Successful or in-progress requests and responses for 
this type of attack will have the Multiplex ID's consisting 82, 81, 65, and 64
as well checking for nt_value for a successful connection. The following
searches for these conditions:
smb.mid == 65 and smb.nt_status == 0 

Reccomendations To Avoid Eternal Blue Attack:
The reason for the vulnerabillity of Eternal Blue would be due to the outdated
version SMB that would be on any given machine. A reccomendation to avoid 
this attack would be to install the MS17-010 security update.
