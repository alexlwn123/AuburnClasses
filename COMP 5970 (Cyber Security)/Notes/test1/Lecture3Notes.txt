Subnetting
  Breaks up into multiple networks
  Optimizes broadcasts

  Network Address Translation
  Configurations:
    Static NAT: internal host communicates with single ip
    Dynamic NAT: communicates with pool of ips
    NAT Overloading: (port address translation) at most 65,000 ports
      IANA: Port Assignment

IPv6
  128 bits
  All 0's compressed ==> ::
  Sections:
    Site Prefix: 48 bits
    Subnet ID: 16 bits
    Interface ID: 64 bits

  Important addresses:
    Loopback ::1
    Global Unicast range  2000::/3
    Link-Local Unicast range fe8::/10
    Multicast range ff00::/8

ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol
  can also identify if local on arp and tcp

  TTL: Time To Live
    Number of network hops before timing out
    Use this to determine operating system
    Linux flavors: 64
    Windows: 128
    ios: 255


Linux Scripting
  Permissions: wrx (read write execute)
    described in binary 0 (000) is none, 7 (111) is all
    chmod: change permissions

IP Security (IPsec)
  IPv4 Optional, IPv6 mandatory
  Transport Mode: only encrypts data
  Tunneling Mode: completely encrypted, data and IP source/destination


Transport Layer
  TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): 3 way handshake
    Handshake: sync port, replies with syn/acknowledgement or reset, final acknowledgement
    Window size established
    Flags

  UDP (User Diagram Protocol): scatter shot
    "Best Effort"
    Data is sent with no regard to reception


Application Layer
  FTP: file transfer protocol, must establish connection first (handshake)
  SSH, SFTP, SCP: encrypted protocols, all on port 22
  Telnet: legacy, unencrypted channel for connections
  SMTP: legacy, mail
  DNS: translates domain to ip address, lots of info, can be used to gather info
  DNSSEC: tamper detection
  SMTP: DO EXERCISE slide 96, 97
  DHCP (Dynamic host configuration protocol)
    Discover Offer Request Acknowledge (DORA)
    Discover: Broadcast sent by host
    Offer: DHCP unicast response and offers address
    Request: host asks to use offered address
    Acknowledge: DHCP Server confirms use
