National Institute of Standards and Technology published NIST Special
Publication 800-181 identifying workforce categories and specialties. 

Penetration Test
	An authorized set of simulated cyber attacks against organizations to 
	identify unknown rouths to access systems and networks
	Identification of only a few threat vectors into a system or network
Vulnerability Assessment
	A technical evaluation of organizational assets to enumerate all
	potential system or network vulnerabilities
Security Test
	A full scope evaluation of organizational assets to enumerate all
	potential system or network vulnerabilities
	Assesses not only technical, but also administrative and management
	controls

A number of professional organizations have created methodologies and
frameworks that define how to effectively conduct security assessments
	OWASP Project Testing Guide
	Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)
	Penetration Testing Framework (PTF)
	Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment
	Information Systems Security Assessment Framework
	Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)
	Cybersecurity Evaluation Tool (CSET)
	
An attack vector is any method used to comprimise administrative,
management, or technical controls and gain unauthorized access to a system
or network.
