Malware
-------
  Viruses:
    Macro: Generated in macro of large program
    Polymorphic: Code changes slightly
    Multipartite: multiple vectors (ie. sits on email and sends emails)

  Worms: stand alone malware, does not require host, first legal cyber case

  Ransomware: encrypts victim information and demand payment to decrypt
  Trojan: hidden behind real programs
  Rootkits: hides malicious activity, go to core of system (Kernel, Library, Application)

  Classification:

  Indicators of Compromise: any indication of malware (ie. slow computer, unusual traffic/ dns requests, strange web traffic)


Network Layer Attacks
  Mac Address Spoofing: mask as another device
  ARP Spoofing: Arp Cache Poisoning: (Gratuitous ARP: responds to broadcast), can do other attacks
  Session Hijacking:
  Keyloggers: Hardware, (KeyGrabber, Key Ghost)
  VLAN Hopping: Double Taggin, Switch spoofing (declare access port as Trunk Port) Frogger, Yersinia

Internet Layer Attacks
  Dos: Ping of Death, Smurf(large number of small pings), macof, Xerxes
  IP Spoofing: Change source ip to hide true source (hping3, scapy)
  Network Proxy: Reroute connection (Proxychains, Tor)

Transport Layer Attacks
  Dos: TCP Null Flood, SYN Flood, Fraggle Attack, UDP Flooding (prevent legitimate users)
  Netcat: (versions: netcat/ nc <vulnerable>, ncat <new>), tcp or udp
    Forwards Traffic, ssl support, chain connections
    Bind connection: handshake, data
