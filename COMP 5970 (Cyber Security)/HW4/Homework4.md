# 1 Define Each of the following extensions:  
    * **.img**: This is an image file, which contains image data for a system. This includes all of the data from a state of a system. From this file, the state can be restored.
    * **.bin**: This is a binary file, which contains compressed binary data. In this context, binary files contain compressed image files and are used to store backups for images.
    * **.trx**: This file stores the test results from Microsoft Visual Studio tests. This is a proprietary file type that only exists on Windows operating systems.

# What is the difference between firmware extensions?:

There are a few distinguishing factors between firmware extensions:  
     * **Compression**: In backups, the firmware files are often compressed into a different file format to save memory.  
     * **Configurations**: Sometimes, there will be firmware files with the same name but different extensions. This can be to distinguish different configuration states. For example, `.RST` files contains the factory defaults while `.ALL` files contain all of the user's current configurations.  


# What is the model number that correlates with each of the files?



# What file system is being used by the file system?



# What compression scheme is being used by the firmware?


# What information in a file system can be used during a penetration test?
